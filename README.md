# Question: How do you solve a sliding window minimum problem efficiently? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a solution to the sliding window minimum problem, which aims to find the minimum element in each subarray of a given size from an array. The code first defines a Deque class with methods to add and remove elements from both ends, and to get the first and last elements. The `slidingWindowMin` function then uses this Deque to keep track of the minimum element in the current window of size `k`. It iterates over the input array, removing elements from the Deque that are out of the current window or larger than the current element, and then adds the current index to the Deque. If the current index is at least `k - 1`, it adds the first element in the Deque (which is the minimum of the current window) to the result array. The function then returns the result array, which contains the minimum element of each subarray of size `k`. The code concludes by calling the `slidingWindowMin` function with a sample array and window size, and logging the result to the console.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of logic and structure. Both versions use a Deque data structure to solve the sliding window minimum problem. However, there are a few differences due to the features and syntax of TypeScript:

1. Type Annotations: TypeScript allows us to specify the type of variables, function parameters, and function return values. In the TypeScript version, we can see type annotations for the Deque class (`<T>`), the `nums` and `k` parameters of the `slidingWindowMin` function (`nums: number[]`, `k: number`), and the return type of the `slidingWindowMin` function (`: number[]`). This can help prevent type-related errors and improve code readability.

2. Class Properties: In TypeScript, class properties must be declared before they can be used. In the Deque class, the `items` property is declared with the `private` keyword, which means it can only be accessed within the class. This is different from JavaScript, where properties can be added to an object at any time and there is no built-in support for private properties.

3. Method Names: The TypeScript version uses different method names for the Deque class (`push`, `pop`, `unshift`, `shift`, `peekFirst`, `peekLast`) compared to the JavaScript version (`addFirst`, `addLast`, `removeFirst`, `removeLast`, `first`, `last`). This doesn't affect the functionality of the code, but it might make the TypeScript version easier to understand for developers familiar with the standard JavaScript array methods.

4. Array Assignment: In the `slidingWindowMin` function, the TypeScript version assigns the minimum number of the window directly to the corresponding index in the result array (`result[windowStart] = deque.peekFirst();`), while the JavaScript version uses the `push` method to add the minimum number to the end of the result array. This difference is due to the different ways the two versions handle the sliding window, but it doesn't change the final result.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses similar logic to the JavaScript version, but there are some differences due to the language features and standard libraries available in C++.

1. Data Structures: In C++, the `deque` and `vector` data structures from the Standard Template Library (STL) are used instead of creating a custom Deque class. The `deque` in C++ is a double-ended queue that allows insertion and removal of elements from both ends, similar to the custom Deque class in JavaScript. The `vector` in C++ is similar to an array in JavaScript, but with additional features like automatic resizing.

2. Methods: The methods used to manipulate the `deque` and `vector` in C++ are slightly different from those in JavaScript. For example, `push_back` and `pop_back` are used instead of `push` and `pop`, and `front` and `back` are used instead of `first` and `last`. Also, `empty` is used to check if the `deque` is empty instead of `isEmpty`.

3. Type Checking: C++ is a statically typed language, so the types of variables and function return values need to be declared explicitly. In the JavaScript version, the types are inferred dynamically at runtime.

4. Input/Output: In the C++ version, the input array and window size are passed as arguments to the `slidingWindowMin` function, and the result is returned as a `vector`. The result is then printed to the console in the `main` function using `std::cout`. In the JavaScript version, the input array and window size are passed directly to the `slidingWindowMin` function, and the result is printed to the console within the same function using `console.log`.

5. Main Function: In C++, the `main` function is the entry point of the program, whereas in JavaScript, the code is executed sequentially from top to bottom.
